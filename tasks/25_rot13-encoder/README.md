### ROT13

ROT13 is one of the simplest and the most widely known cipher. Also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus `A` ↔ `N`, `B` ↔ `O` and so on.

Write a function which takes a string as input and returns ROT13 encoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
