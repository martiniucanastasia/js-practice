### Maximum Product

Given an array of integers, find the maximum product obtained from multiplying 2 adjacent numbers in the array.

Notes:
* Array size is at least 2.
* Array numbers could be a mixture of positives, negatives also zeros.

Examples:

```javascript
maxProduct([1, 2, 3]); // returns 6
```

Explanation:
The maximum product obtained from multiplying 2 * 3 = 6, and they're adjacent numbers in the array.

```javascript
maxProduct([9, 5, 10, 2, 24, -1, -48]); // returns 50
```

Explanation:
Max product obtained from multiplying 5 * 10 = 50.
