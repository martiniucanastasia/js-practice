### Factorize number

Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter `n`, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation `n!`.

```javascript
factorialize(5); // returns 120, 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
```
