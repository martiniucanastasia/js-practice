### Least common multiple in range

Find the least common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, as well as by **all** sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.

The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order. e.g. for 1 and 3 - find the least common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3.

```javascript
leastCommonMultipleInRange([1, 5]); // returns 60
```
