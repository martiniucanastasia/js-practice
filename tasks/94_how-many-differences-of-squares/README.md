### How Many Differences of Squares?

Some numbers can be expressed as a difference of two squares, for example, `20 = 6^2 - 4^2` and `21 = 5^2 - 2^2`. Many numbers can be written this way, but not all.

Write a function that takes a positive integer *n* and returns the amount of numbers between 1 and *n* (inclusive) that can be represented as the difference of two perfect squares.

Note: Your code should be able to handle *n* values up to `45000`.
