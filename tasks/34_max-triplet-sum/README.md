### Maximum Triplet Sum

Given an array of n integers, find the sum of the three highest unique ones.

Notes:
* The array has at least 3 elements.
* Some numbers can occur in the array multiple times, and duplicates should be included only once when selecting the highest values.

```javascript
maxTripletSum ([-7, 12, -7, 29, -5, 0, -7, 0, 0, 29]); // returns 41
```
Explanation:
As the triplet of highest values here is `[12 , 29 , 0]`, their sum is 41.
