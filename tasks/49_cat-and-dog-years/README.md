### Cats and Dogs years

I have a cat and a dog. I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Write a function that returns their respective ages now as `[humanYears, catYears, dogYears]`.

Notes:

humanYears >= 1

Cat Years:
* 15 cat years for first year
* +9 cat years for second year
* +4 cat years for each year after that

Dog Years:
* 15 dog years for first year
* +9 dog years for second year
* +5 dog years for each year after that
