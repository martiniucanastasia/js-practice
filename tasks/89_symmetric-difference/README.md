### Symmetric Difference

Write a function that takes two **or more** arrays and returns an array of the *symmetric difference* of the provided arrays.

Given two sets (for example set *A = {1, 2, 3}* and set *B = {2, 3, 4}*), the mathematical term "symmetric difference" of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets, but not in both (*A â–³ B = C = {1, 4}*).

```javascript
symmetricDifference([1, 2, 5], [2, 3, 5], [3, 4, 5]); // returns [1, 4, 5]
```
