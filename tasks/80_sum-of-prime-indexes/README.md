### Sum of prime-indexed elements

You will be given an integer array and your task is to return the sum of elements occupying prime-numbered indices.

To make this interesting, array lengths in random tests will have up to 5000 elements.

Note: A *prime number* is a whole *number* greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. A factor is a whole numbers that can be divided evenly into another *number*. The first few *prime numbers* are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29.
