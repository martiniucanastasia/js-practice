### Calculate Primorial Of a Number

**Primorial Of a Number** is similar to factorial of a number. In primorial, not all the natural numbers get multiplied, only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number. It's denoted with `P#`.

Given a number N , calculate its primorial.

Notes:
* Only positive numbers will be passed (N > 0) .

Examples:

```javascript
numPrimorial(3); // returns 30
```

Since the passed number is (3), then the primorial should obtained by multiplying `2 * 3 * 5 = 30`. Mathematically written as `P3# = 30`.

```javascript
numPrimorial(5); // returns 2310
```

Since the passed number is (5), then the primorial should obtained by multiplying `2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310`. Mathematically written as `P5# = 2310`.
